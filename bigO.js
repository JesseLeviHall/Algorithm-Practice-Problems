Notes from Algo class for flash cards. 

Big O allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grow. 
O(n) means runtime grown proportionally to n. Rule of thumb a loop. 
O(1) means constant time always same number of calculations no matter what n is
O(n2) means maybe a nested loop, runtime squared by what input is. 

The logarithm of a number (usually log2 as log) roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value thats less than or equal to one. Ex: log(8) = 3
Shows up in search algorithms, sorting, recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity (not time).
