/*
ES 2015 class syntax is syntactical sugar.
creating a new object must be called constructor.
the class keyword creates a constant, so you can not redefine it.
the syntax:
class Student {
  constructor (firstName, lastName){
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
let firstStudent = new Student("Colt", "Steele");
let secondStudent = new Student("blue", "Steele");
